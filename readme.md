# Welcome to the code club data logger 
This code base runs a small web server using [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)

There are some fairly advanced concepts in here so don't worry if you don't understand all of it, I've tried to add as many comments as possible to try to guide you through how this all works. 

## Technologies used 
### Python
This is the main programming language in this project it is used to connect to the database, build web pages to display to the user and accept data from your pico which it then shows on a web page.

### HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
This is the standard method of building web pages, all web browsers read these files and turn them into what you see on your screen.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to modify how HTML is displayed to a user, it tells the browser everthing about how it should format the HTML, for example where to position things on the page and what colour they should be.

### JS (JavasScript)
JS is what makes web pages interactive, every time you click a button on a website there is some JavaScript that runs to do whatever that button is supposed to do. 

### Sql (Structured Query Language) and SQlite
SQlite is a database which we use to store all of the data that is displayed to the user on the site, SQL is the language that is used to communicate with the database. You can think of SQlite as a glorified spreadsheet, in fact you can use a modified version of SQL to do fancy things inside a spreadsheet.
